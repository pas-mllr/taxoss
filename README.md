# TaxOSS

A community index of open-source tax software, live at
[tax-oss.com](https://tax-oss.com).

TaxOSS is a fork of the MIT-licensed
[LegalOSS](https://github.com/eigenweltlabs/legaloss) by
[Eigenwelt Labs](https://eigenweltlabs.com), rebranded and re-scoped for the
tax software ecosystem.

## Rules of the index

1. **Real repositories only.** Stats come from GitHub and Hugging Face, never
   from the submitter.
2. **One entry per repository.** Uniqueness is enforced on the case-insensitive
   `owner/repo` key; renames are re-canonicalized on refresh.
3. **Claims are proven, not asserted.** The claim flow fetches the user's GitHub
   OAuth token from Clerk and checks `permissions.admin` on the repo (with a
   numeric owner-ID fallback for personal repos); Hugging Face claims match the
   whoami-v2 identity or an organization role. Maintainers who would rather
   grant no OAuth scope at all can instead publish a per-person token in
   `taxoss-verify.txt` (or the README), which is read back anonymously — the
   only route that works for Hugging Face organizations without also granting
   `read-repos` over private repositories. Only the verified claimant can edit a
   project's name, tagline, website, categories, and maintainer's note.

Browsing needs no account. Signed-in members can star, review, comment, and
submit projects.
