          TaxOSS is a small index of open-source tax software. Every entry
          is a real GitHub repository, its stats come straight from GitHub, and
          each repository can be listed exactly once. Browsing needs no
          account.

            A project page belongs to whoever can prove they control the
            repository. There are two ways to prove it, both about a minute.
            Sign in, open the project page, hit &quot;Claim this project&quot;,
            and pick one.

              Verify. We ask the source whether your account controls the repo —
              GitHub admin permission, or a matching Hugging Face identity.

              The claim page shows you a token. It is tied to your account and
              that one project, so nobody else&apos;s token will work and yours
              is worthless anywhere else.

              <span className="mono">taxoss-verify.txt</span> at the root of
              the repository, on the default branch. Pasting the same line
              anywhere in the README works just as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Come back and verify. We fetch the file the way any visitor would
              — anonymously, over the public URL. Delete it afterwards if you
              like; the claim stays.

            This route exists because Hugging Face has no read-only
            &quot;which organizations am I in&quot; scope: the only scope that
            proves membership also grants read access to an account&apos;s
            private repositories. Publishing a token in a repository you already
            control proves the same thing and grants us nothing.
