            We use PostHog (EU cloud, hosted in Frankfurt) to understand how
            the index is used. If you accept the cookie banner, PostHog sets
            first-party cookies and may record sessions with all inputs
            masked. If you decline — or never answer — no analytics cookies
            are set and nothing is stored on your device; usage is measured
            through a short-lived, non-reversible server-side hash instead. IP
            addresses are discarded at ingestion. You can change your mind by
            clearing this site&apos;s data in your browser, which brings the
            banner back.

            Sign-in is handled by Clerk. We store your Clerk user id, display
            name, avatar, and — if you connect GitHub for a maintainer claim —
            your public GitHub login. The claim flow reads only your public
            identity and repository permission level; it has no repository
            scopes. Deleting your account removes this mirror.

          <p className="body">
            The featured-projects newsletter runs on Brevo. Subscribing stores
            your email address there; every issue carries an unsubscribe link,
            and unsubscribing removes you from the list. Your address is used
            for nothing else.

        <div className="stack-8">

          <p className="body">
            Everything shown about a project — stars, forks, issues, license,
            README, contributors — is public data fetched from the GitHub API
            and cached server-side. Nothing is scraped from private sources.
            Maintainers can have their project removed by contacting us.

            The site runs on Microsoft Azure in the West Europe region
            (Netherlands). Standard server logs (IP address, request path,
            timestamp) exist briefly for operations and abuse prevention.
